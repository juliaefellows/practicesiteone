			<h2>Brief Synopsis of Self</h2>
			<p>Born in southern Connecticut, I am privileged to have had an idyllic childhood. Whilst in middle school, the, not-so-idyllic, pubescent years, my dad was called to a church in northern Virginia. Having met at HDS, both my parents are ordained ministers...a fact which has not been impactful to my identity whatsoever. *I kid.* I became a product of FCPS, and applied, early-decision, to Elon University. Learning of my admission in November, 2013, while stressful, was also "freeing," as I had determined the location of my continued education. Recruited by Teach for America, during the fall of 2017, I was relieved, as, despite several internships, the interdisciplinary nature of public health was not especially promising, as far as immediate employment. During the summer of 2018, it became clear that life's season would not allow me to give my all to teaching. I applied to two other jobs, and chose to work at Mason in August, 2018. A *happy* fact: I met my husband at the age of 15. We dated throughout high school and college, and were married in November, 2018. Marriage is a gift. A *sad* fact: In a matter of two weeks, on July 18th, 2019, my dad, who exercised more than I, died. The loss is excruciating. Grief is non-linear. My (only) sister is 17. In otherÂ news, I enjoy cultivating -- communicating, verbally (orating, writing, singing, etc.) and nonverbally (dancing, painting, sketching, etc.), hiking, and home-making. I have an affinity for wicker and dried flowers. I am wary of stagnancy in personal-growth. 2019 and 2020 have certainly allowed for such growth.</p>
